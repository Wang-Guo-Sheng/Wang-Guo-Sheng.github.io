 这是看 Ian Parker 书 *SLAVOJ ZIZEK A Critical Introduction* 抄的笔记。

# 引言——回溯与期冀

> 一切都好，唯独缺少红墨水。

`西伯利亚红蓝墨水的故事`是他最常用的开场白。

1. 东欧背景：犬儒用红蓝墨水应付国家权力，国家权力把它变成了相反的游戏。
2. 黑格尔主义：辩证反转。
	1. 只有否定才能达到目的
	2. 必须包含自身才能说出真相
3. 弗洛伊德：精神分析。
	1. 笑话：把真相包裹在其它东西里安全地表达出来，并在结尾传递一点愉快
	2. 只有可以说谎时才可以达到真相（拉康）
4. 审查的意识形态本质。
	1. 主人公清楚斯大林主义的真相，然而他仍以斯大林主义的方式说话，然而他仍可传达他的抵抗
5. 写作风格：主旨的反转
6. 他运用黑格尔、拉康和马克思的概念，但是与他们的本义不同。

齐泽克的观点立场并不连贯甚至自相矛盾，重要的是他所讨论的概念和问题的领域。

## 崇高客体（1989）

### 写作背景

流行文化的政治分析。Laclau希望把后结构主义（超越概念的选择组合）与实用主义（美式改变世界，让历史轨迹迅速发展，把经典马克思主义改变世界的脚步远远抛在后面）结合拯救左翼政府，齐泽克研究前者较多。Laclau和Mouffe帮助他进入了公众讨论的范围。

### 读者的热情

崇高客体：主体想象自己已经逃离意识形态，同时仍被被意识形态所束缚。

- 左翼文化理论家阅读齐泽克的愉悦感：来自*政治*因素的吸引。

	*For They Know Not What They Do: Enjoyment as a Political Factor* （1991），介绍拉康。

	- 关乎斯洛文尼亚第一次选举。
	- 从黑格尔出发，分析铁托-斯大林主义统治到民族-民粹主义统治的转变。
	- 用拉康精神分析的概念解释流行文化。

- 流行读者：
	- 笑话，小说，电影： *Looking Awry, Enjoy Your Symptom, Everything You Always Wanted to Know about Lacan (But Were Afraid to Ask Hitchcock)*

### 政治坐标：Definitely ‘no’, but then of course ‘yes’.

读者和批评家热衷于讨论他写作的激情能量，讲话的纵横恣睢，思维跳跃，书籍高产。
他与雅克-阿兰-米勒一起刺探精神分析一年而不说任何会泄露他的消息，拒绝做任何与学术任命有关的行政工作。
这至少说明了许多人想象他们被吸引到齐泽克的作品中时，所读到的东西。

**症状的形象：不，从来不去画廊；是，这次很有趣，一定会去。**

作品与理论来源的联系：

- *Tarrying with the Negative* **(1993)** reading of Lacan through Hegel
- *The Ticklish Subject* **(1999)** where he stands between Martin Heidegger, Alain Badiou and Judith Butler
- Debate with Butler and Laclau in Contingency, Hegemony, Universality **(2000)** injunction to ‘repeat Lenin’
- *Did Somebody Say Totalitarianism?* **(2000)** admiration of Stalin

只有知道他写作的**政治坐标**，才能理解 Marx, Hegel and Lacan 在他的评论中是怎样运用的，比如关于科索沃和911。

他是个 Slovenian Lacanian Hegelian ，三个词的顺序不一定，取决于作品是写给谁的。
他说话时支持谁反对谁也不一定：他的作品有种政治上的紧迫性，必然代表这种或那种阵营；同时又具有完全相反的一面。
他的理论立场总是先由它反对的对象否定地界定：**definitely ‘no’, but then of course ‘yes’**.
"从拒绝开始 "的作用是在这三个术语--"斯洛文尼亚式"、"拉康式"、"黑格尔式"--中的每一个术语的情况下定义身份的产生，这包括拒绝使其从属于其他两个术语。

这种**通过谬误达致真理**的方式来自 Hegel ，Hegel 的立场是通过与 Kant 的对抗定义的。
精神分析整合为检验真理的试金石，通过拉康的“回归”弗洛伊德，即清除英美临床派的错误。
斯洛文尼亚在帝国主义体系中的自我认同。
齐泽克从卢布尔雅那的研究者到文化大使、各种政治和理论选区的代言人，以及在许多其他国家的访问学者，他的轨迹同样可以被理解为一个黑格尔式的拉康式的斯洛文尼亚人。

## MAPPING THIS BOOK

为了理解他把不同政治项目和理论资源结合起来的方式，第一章写了南斯拉夫的形成和解体，以及齐泽克在其中的位置。
斯洛文尼亚和法国是他收集和演练其哲学、精神分析、政治批评的纲领的地方。

1. ‘Slovene Lacanian School’ 的概念源流范围。
卢布里雅纳的社科研究涵盖犯罪学、法学到民族学、电影理论。齐泽克的作品试图传播这些理论。
在这里，理论上的利害关系远不止于如何解读拉康，我们还需要对精神分析和哲学中其他竞争性传统的局部吸收进行一些评估。

2. 把这些理论介绍到国外读者的连接点。

阅读齐泽克的思想诞生的政治经济结点，必须描述南斯拉夫国家的历史形成，以及它的各个主体经历的相互矛盾的要求，因为它们们活出了所谓 "社会主义 "社会的辩证张力。
这里，马克思和马克思主义处在与国家机器的关系之中，而后者用马克思主义的修辞钳制工人和知识分子。
书中循着南斯拉夫的特点和它处理异见者的意识形态控制方法，以及文化和哲学实践在斯洛文尼亚析离中起的作用。
然后，外国读者才可以分辨这种语境下的 Hegel, Lacan and Marx，以及三者奇谲的斯洛文尼亚式混合。
恰恰在南斯拉夫转向市场化的"自由"之时，这个Hegelian Lacanian合体受到了别处的后马克思主义者关注；这不是巧合。
西方看东欧，发现又享受'民主的重塑'。齐泽克对此的尖锐评论，牵连着齐泽克也为西方重塑了自己的过程。

The forms of that re-invention and the different guises he adopts for different audiences need to be disentangled if we are not also to be trapped in the line of an admiring or dismissive gaze on his work.

We then turn to focus on Hegel, Lacan and Marx, locating them in relation to Zizek’s various projects and exploring the dialectical interrelationships between them. 
The next chapter, on enlightenment, shows why Hegel’s work is so important to Zizek, and what he does with it. 
I trace the argument presented in Zizek’s philosophical manifesto Tarrying with the Negative (first published in 1993), through to his defence of Christianity in On Belief (from 2001). 
These two works anchor an account of Hegel and provide the ground for exploring certain key concepts that appear repeatedly in Zizek’s writing. 
They also serve as the setting for examining some assumptions in Hegel’s work that Zizek is happy to run with but which we should perhaps be a little more wary about.

Hegel is the founding figure for much recent French philosophy, and his work lies not only in the background of contemporary discussions of phenomenology and hermeneutics, but it is also often an implicit reference point even for arguments from within ‘post-structuralism’that pretend to have nothing to do with Hegel. 
Zizek’s retrieval of Hegel is valuable because it shows why certain theoretical notions in his writing – Truth arising through error, the production of ‘substance as subject’, universality in the particular – are crucial to philosophy (and then to psychoanalysis and politics). 
We will look at those connections between Hegel and other domains of work toward the end of the chapter.

Zizek proceeds, in true Hegelian fashion, by specifying Hegel against what he is not. 
This means that we also need to locate them both in relation to other philosophical traditions, the most important for our purposes here being Kant. 
Hegel then needs to be treated, as Zizek suggests, as a space to think, as shifting and opening up new ideas. 
This is more in keeping with what Hegel was trying to do than if he had been describing a positive, fullyformed system that might then pretend to solve all the problems of philosophy. 
Negativity is at the heart of Hegel, and it is Zizek’s task to keep that negativity at work while reading him. 
The points at which motifs of negativity turn into formulaic injunctions in his work then need to be analysed so that the limitations of Zizek’s version of Hegel can be understood.

The discussion of psychoanalysis in the following chapter focuses on two key texts to illustrate how Zizek uses ideas from psychoanalysis to read popular culture, and the way he buys into certain psychoanalytic notions about representation and the subject. 
The first is Looking Awry, which appeared in 1991. 
This book not only employs notions of fantasy, trauma and unconscious desire to interpret science fiction and detective novels, but it also makes of these cultural phenomena sites to illustrate key concepts in Lacanian psychoanalysis. 
That is the way I use Zizek’s text here.

The second text is the summary and position statement in The Metastases of Enjoyment published in 1994, where Zizek deals, among other things, with femininity and feminist responses to psychoanalysis. 
That book is the setting for a review of ideas from the rival Frankfurt School tradition of psychoanalytic social theory that have been so appealing and problematic for many radicals, and it tackles the worries of those sympathetic to Lacan as a progressive alternative, and ostensibly more politically sensitive ‘return’, to Freud.

However, Zizek does more than this, for his description of Lacanian concepts is also an opportunity to explicate further how useful Hegel is. 
As we explore Lacan, then, we will also be drawing on the material in the previous chapter to explore the way Lacan is indebted to Hegel, and then to question Zizek about this. 
Lacanian psychoanalysis, for Zizek, is not only a reading of popular culture; it is also a way of intervening in political debate, as we will see in his discussion of the nation as ‘thing’in Looking Awry and of ‘sexuation’ in The Metastases of Enjoyment. 
The way Zizek repeats standard psychoanalytic attempts to comment upon political phenomena, and the way he attempts to invent some connections of his own between psychoanalysis and culture need to be traced out and assessed.

This brings us to the chapter on politics, which turns to Zizek’s relationship to Marxism, and what he says about it. 
After the close examination of Zizek’s take on philosophy and psychoanalysis, we will be in a better position to appreciate his use of Hegelian and Lacanian ideas as political critique. 
His ground-breaking 1989 book The Sublime Object of Ideology lays out a political trajectory that is repeated and elaborated in more recent texts. 
It is worth spending a little time to pick apart the way his reading of Marx can give rise to a distinctive and innovative account of ideology, but also how his reading of Marx strikes some crucial political distance from Marxist politics.

I look at the place of the sublime object in the context of ‘post-Marxist’ political theory, as well as in Zizek’s own work. 
This is the book that made Zizek so attractive to Marxists looking for a way out of the deadlock and failure of Western Marxism, but it is actually already quite critical of Marxism. 
Zizek’s later writing then seems to move closer to Marxism but in such a way as to cause great anxiety among many Marxist readers. 
We shall take the ‘Afterword: Lenin’s Choice’from Revolution at the Gates as our second main reference point in this chapter in order to examine this paradoxical shift in Zizek’s work.

Zizek’s political interventions with respect to the legacy of Lenin and Stalin and what can be learnt from them, and around Kosovo and the attacks on the World Trade Center, raise questions not only about the nature of democracy and ‘terror’ in his work but also about what exactly is being ‘repeated’ when he writes about Marx. 
The oscillation between different political positions in his work needs to be highlighted if any accurate critical assessment of these interventions is to be made.

There is much in Zizek’s work that escapes reduction to a simple mixture of Hegel, Lacan and Marx and so I look in the concluding chapter at how the different theoretical threads of work are knotted together by him.

Here I also examine the existing critical responses to Zizek. 
If there is one good critical way into Zizek, it is actually through the claim to fidelity that he makes about each of these traditions. 
This is why I review briefly some main lines of argument against Zizek, within and outwith these traditions, that have appeared recently. 
The chapter uses the fault-lines in his readings of Hegel, Lacan and Marx that have been identified in the preceding chapters to trace some consequences for his work and its reception by academics and activists. 
This review cues you into the field of debate around Zizek. 
But then we go further. 
The final chapter combines what we are now able to notice, now retroactively, in his writings over the last 15 years and focuses on his writings on culture – in Everything You Always Wanted to Know about Lacan (But Were Afraid to Ask Hitchcock) **(1992)** and The Plague of Fantasies **(1997)**, for example – to get a fix on how the puzzling inconsistencies in his writing are organised. 
What we need to be able to grasp is the specific asymmetric relationship in his writing between philosophy, psychoanalysis and politics. 
Then we might at least be able to get a fix on why it seems so difficult to sum up who he is and where he is going.

导读给出的是阅读齐泽克的一种方式，从略微不同的拉康/黑格尔/马克思主义理论坐标出发，产生批判性的视角。
黑格尔的问题很多，拉康的问题不比弗洛伊德少;齐泽克的马克思主义和马克思主义者的也不尽相同.

马克思主义强调集体抵抗当代资本主义的理论和*实践*，而精神分析与经院哲学可能搅乱/弱化马克思主义政治。为什么要引入这些？

用革命马克思主义分析社会主义东欧的腐败，可以理解许多人的右转。而拉康精神分析质问个人主体性的形成；把国家压迫与个人伤感用黑格尔主义辩证综合，可以联系马克思与拉康而不致于把一个约化为另一个或者黑格尔自身。齐泽克展示了整合这些不同的理论资源的有力方式。这是“错误”的方式，但他迫使我们思考：做什么才能把它改正确？
